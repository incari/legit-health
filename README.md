# React & TypeScript Technical Test

## Objective
Your main objective is to create a simple React application using TypeScript to consume the API exposed by [https://reqres.in/](https://reqres.in/).

**Duration:** 3 to 4 hours.

## Core Features
1. **User List Page:**
   - Create a page that lists users fetched from the API. Each user entry should display at least:
     - Profile picture
     - First and last name
     - Email
2. **User Details Page:**
   - Upon clicking a user entry in the User List Page, navigate to a User Details Page that displays:
     - Profile picture
     - First and last name
     - Email
     - Any additional details provided by the API for that specific user.
3. **User Creation Form:**
   - Implement a form to create a new user:
     - Fields should include first name, last name, and email.
     - On submission, simulate an API call to "create" the user (using the POST API provided by reqres.in). Inform the user about the success or failure of the operation.

## Bonus Features (Not Mandatory, but a Plus)
- Pagination on the User List Page.
- Error handling for API calls (e.g., show a message if data fetching fails).
- An appealing design or UI touches.
- Any additional features that you believe would make this application stand out!
- Use React Hook Form library to handle the form

## Requirements
- Use React & TypeScript.
- It would be beneficial (but not mandatory) if you use any of the following libraries: NextJS, Mui, React Query, React Router, React Hook Forms.
- Use fetch to make API calls.

## Documentation
- Provide a README in your repository. This should explain:
  - How to run your application.
  - Any design or architectural choices you made and why.
  - Any additional features or functionalities you added and a brief reasoning behind them.

## Submission
- Push your code to a Git repository.
- Share the link to the repository with us for review.

## Tips
- Your understanding and application of React and TypeScript are essential. Focus on showcasing this.
- Clean, modular, and well-commented code is always appreciated.
- Feel free to be creative. Any additional features or innovative ideas you bring to the table are a plus!
